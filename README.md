## ATM Machine Simulator - Build Your Node.js Banking App

This project lets you build and experiment with a command-line ATM machine simulation using Node.js.  Test your programming skills by implementing core functionalities and user interactions!

**Features:**

* **Command-Line ATM Interface:**  Replicate a standard ATM interface for a realistic user experience. (not implemented yet)
* **Simulated Account System:**  Develop a virtual account system using Node.js data structures for users to interact with, allowing features like balance inquiries and withdrawals.
* **Secure PIN Verification:**  Implement a secure PIN verification system using encryption or hashing techniques (like bcrypt) to protect user accounts. (not implemented yet)
* **User-friendly Menu Navigation:**  Design a clear and easy-to-use menu system for users to navigate through various ATM functionalities using the command line.

**Getting Started:**

1.  **Prerequisites:** This project requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to be installed on your system. Download them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://NotAnonymousUser/ATM-Machine.git
   ```

3.  **Run the Application:**  Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.  Then, execute the following command to start the ATM simulator:
   ```bash
   npx @muhammad-mubeen-javed/atm-machine
   ```

**Contributing:**

We encourage you to contribute to this project and make it even better! Here are some ways you can help:

*  **Implement Core Functionalities:**  Develop the core functionalities of the ATM, including functionalities like:
      * Login and PIN verification
      * Balance inquiries
      * Cash withdrawals (withdrawing in multiples of bills)
      * Optionally, implement features like deposits or transfers (depending on the complexity you desire).
*  **Error Handling:**  Incorporate robust error handling to gracefully manage user input mistakes and unexpected situations.
*  **Enhance User Experience:**  Improve the user experience by adding features like transaction history or account information display. 
*  **Use External Libraries:** Consider using libraries for user interaction and potentially a file system library to store account data persistently. 
*  **Write Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests to ensure the code functions as intended and to catch bugs early in development.

This is a great opportunity to learn and practice your Node.js development skills while building a practical application!
